```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) # do not show code
source('analysis.R') # obtain code from analysis.R
raw_data <- read_data(data_file) %>% refactor_data()
```

In this report we will analyse Levshina's *doen-laten* dataset,
which as `r nrow(raw_data)` rows and `r length(raw_data)` columns.
We've run logistic regression to predict the odds of *doen* against *laten* based on the different predictors.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m <- model(raw_data)
summary(m)
```

The $C$ value of the logistic regression model is `r sprintf("%.3f", get_c(m, raw_data))`.
