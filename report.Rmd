In this report we will analyse Levshina's *doen-laten* dataset,
which as `r nrow(data)` rows and `r length(data)` columns.
We've run logistic regression to predict the odds of *doen* against *laten* based on the different predictors.
We are now running everything with `targets`!.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(tar_read(m))
```

The $C$ value of the logistic regression model is `r sprintf("%.3f", tar_read(C))`.
